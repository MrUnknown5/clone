<h2>7. CANCELLING YOUR MEMBERSHIP</h2>
<p>Members on a Monthly Minimum Term Membership contract may cancel their Membership after or with effect from the end of the minimum term, by giving one full calendar month's advance written notice, effective from the 1st of the following month. This should be done by completing a Cancellation Request using the GYMBOX Online Member Services function. This can be found on the GYMBOX website using the following link <a href="member-services.html">http://gymbox.com/member-services</a>.<br></p>
<p>A GYMBOX team member will respond to all cancellation requests. If confirmation of cancellation is not received, the Member is responsible for re-submitting the cancellation request.
</p>
<p>Where the payment method is Direct Debit, the Member must advise their bank to cancel the Direct Debit instruction after the final payment has been made. GYMBOX is not obliged to refund any fees where the Member has not cancelled the instruction and cannot provide proof of a valid cancellation request. All fees must be paid to date at the time of cancellation.
</p>
<p>Paid in Full Memberships will expire automatically at the end of the term, unless the Member chooses to renew their Membership. No refunds are applicable for any portion of fees paid upfront, excluding in the following circumstances: redundancy, permanent illness and permanent injury preventing gym usage. Valid documentation will be requested as proof in such circumstances.
</p>
<p>All Members who opt for a No Commitment Membership can terminate their Membership by cancelling the direct debit authorisation directly through their bank or building society. It is the Members responsibility to ensure enough notice is provided to the bank/building society to prevent the next payment. GYMBOX recommends at least 5 working days. Cancellations cannot be backdated and payments taken successfully will not be refunded. When a direct debit payment is unsuccessful, access will be denied with immediate effect and the Membership will be terminated within two working days. Should a Member wish to continue a Membership following a failed direct debit they may contact the membership team via <a href="member-services.html">http://gymbox.com/member-services</a> to discuss available options.<br></p>
<p>Should a Member be unable to use the Club for the remainder of the term, the Member may apply to transfer the Contract to another person. The Member is responsible for finding someone, who is not already a Member of a GYMBOX Club, to take over the balance of the Membership. A Transfer Fee will apply as per the Club's current price schedule. Both the existing Member (where possible) and the new Member must attend the Club to complete the transfer application, which will not be deemed complete until a Membership Application Form has been completed and signed by the new proposed Member and GYMBOX has accepted that person as a Member.
</p>
<p>Members still within the minimum contractual period may reduce their cancellation notice to one full calendar month in the following circumstances: Pregnancy, Redundancy, Permanent injury and Permanent illness preventing gym usage. Valid documentation will be requested as proof in such circumstances.
</p>
<p>Any Member with three or more months remaining of the minimum term may terminate their Membership at the end of the then current month by paying in full 50% of the total future fees due until the end of the minimum term.
</p>
<p>Please contact the GYMBOX membership team via the following link for more information: <a href="member-services.html">http://gymbox.com/member-services</a>.</p>
<h2>8. PRESALE - 14 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE</h2>
<p>A "14 Day Money Back Guarantee" is applicable when a Member signs up to a new Club during its presale period. A presale period is defined as the time in which a Membership can be purchased for a new Club prior to the opening date.
</p>
<p>During the designated 14 days, a Member may request immediate termination of their new Membership, along with a refund of fees paid upon joining (including the joining fee).
</p>
<p>The 14 days is effective from, and including, the agreed original start date of their Membership.
</p>
<p>A Member can only have a maximum of one visit of the new Club recorded on their Membership to be eligible for this 14 day money back offer. Upon visiting the facilities and using the new Club a second time, the member is confirming they will commit to the full terms of their chosen Membership.
</p>
<p>In cases where the Member has opted to use an existing GYMBOX site prior to the new location opening, the 14 day money back offer will not apply.</p>
<h2>9. TRANSFERRING MEMBERSHIP TO ANOTHER CLUB </h2>
<p>A Member can apply to move their Membership to another Club after the first four weeks of membership is complete. A price increase or package change may apply depending on the prevailing rate for their Membership at the requested Club.
</p>
<h2>10. FREEZING YOUR MEMBERSHIP </h2>
<p>Any Member may apply for their Membership to be frozen or unfrozen by completing a request via the GYMBOX Online Member Services function using the following link, <a href="member-services.html">http://gymbox.com/member-services</a>.</p>
<p>The minimum freeze period is one full calendar month, commencing on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the month, with a maximum of six full consecutive calendar months.
</p>
<p>A Member must request the freeze by the 20<sup>th</sup> day of the month prior to the requested freeze start date. For example, a Member who wishes to freeze commencing 1<sup>st</sup> June, must complete the online request by 20<sup>th</sup> May. A freeze request completed on 21<sup>st</sup> May would only be eligible for a freeze start date as of 1<sup>st</sup> July.
</p>
<p>A fee of £15 per month applies throughout the period of frozen Membership. Freeze periods will not count towards a Member's contractual term, and will extend any applicable minimum term by the number of frozen months taken. Membership may not be frozen during the notice period of cancellation.
</p>
<p>Members on a Monthly contract type will have their freeze fee(s) taken via Direct Debit; Members on a Paid in Full contract type must settle their freeze fee(s) upfront in advance.
</p>
<p>Freezing for reasons of illness, injury or pregnancy will be reviewed and leniency may be applied in relation to the fee and notice period; valid medical documentation must be attached to the request for this to be considered. If valid dated documentation is provided, a freeze due to medical/injury reasons may be backdated, providing no usage has been registered on the Member’s account. In such circumstances no refund would be due and any fees paid would be credited to future Membership payments.
</p>
<p>Any Member who requests to freeze their Membership under the Terms and Conditions will not be able to access the Club during the frozen period, either via their Membership or purchase of a Guest Pass. A Member must apply to unfreeze their Membership if wishing to use the Club during the frozen period. In order to unfreeze a Membership, a pro rata fee for the remainder of the then current month will be payable. The freeze fee of £15 is not payable towards this pro rata fee.</p>
<h2>11. CLUB FACILITIES </h2>
<p>Full details of normal opening hours are available upon request at each Club. GYMBOX reserves the right to vary normal opening hours, temporarily remove the access to certain equipment, or to temporarily close certain areas of any Club from time to time without notice for various purpose including for cleaning, decorating, repairs, refurbishment, or for special functions and holidays. </p>
<h2>12. HEALTH AND SAFETY</h2>
<p>All Club users must complete a health questionnaire (PARQ) before entry. If any medical conditions are disclosed, the user must sign the back of the PARQ stating that they have sought medical advice or wish to use the Club without doing so, and that they take full responsibility for any injury or health condition sustained whilst using the facilities arising from their medical condition. GYMBOX staff are not medically trained and are therefore not qualified to assess whether the Club user is in appropriate physical condition to use the facilities. GYMBOX advises all Club users to take medical advice prior to starting any exercise programme if they are in any doubt as to their ability to do so.
</p>
<p>The Member warrants and represents upon their Membership Application Form, and repeats such warranty upon each visit to the Club, that they are in good physical condition and know of no medical or other reason why they should not engage in any form of exercise, and that such exercise would not be detrimental to their health, safety, comfort or physical condition.</p>
<h2>13. PERSONAL TRAINING</h2>
<p>The Very Personal Trainers (VPT) that operate within Club are not employees of GYMBOX, but are self-employed, independent freelance trainers. In using a VPT you are entering into an agreement with the VPT alone and not with GYMBOX.
</p>
<h2>14. RELOCATION OF A CLUB BY GYMBOX</h2>
<p>GYMBOX may re-locate a Club, or open a new Club near to the Member's then current Club. In such case, GYMBOX may, on no less than 4 weeks' written notice to the Member, notify the Member that the relocated Club or the new Club is to be the Club in respect of which the Member has their Membership.
</p>
<p>a) If the re-located Club or new Club is one third of a mile or less from the Member's current Club, the Member's membership will automatically transfer to the re-located Club or new Club. In such case, all terms and conditions relating to the Member’s current membership will continue in full force and effect, applying to the relocated or new Club
</p>
<p>b) If the re-located Club or new Club is more than one third of a mile from the Member's current Club, and the Member does not agree to such relocation, the Member may terminate this Contract, effective on the date the Member’s current Club closes. In such cases GYMBOX will notify the Member of the relocation in writing, no less than 2 full calendar month’s in advance of the relocation date. The member must give one full calendar month’s advance notice, effective on the first of the following month, by completing a Cancellation Request using the GYMBOX online Member Services function. <a href="member-services.html">http://gymbox.com/member-services</a>. Should the member accept the relocation, the member may, during the first 10 days of the new or relocated club opening, cancel their current contract with one full calendar months written notice. In such case, from the 11th day of the new club opening, all terms and conditions relating to the Member’s current membership will continue in full force and effect, applying to the relocated or new Club. </p>
<h2>15. TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP BY GYMBOX</h2>
<p>GYMBOX may terminate a Membership without notice and with immediate effect if:
</p>
<ul> <li>The Member breaches these Terms & Conditions or the Club Rules, either repeatedly or because of one serious breach;
</li><li>Any due fees remain unpaid after any request for payment by GYMBOX;
</li><li>GYMBOX is of the opinion (acting in its discretion) that the Member is not suitable for continued Membership;
</li><li>The Member puts the health, safety or well-being of staff or other Members or Guests at risk.
</li></ul>
<p>All decisions made by GYMBOX under this clause are final and binding. GYMBOX is unlikely to accept a new application for Membership from someone whose Membership has been terminated in accordance with this clause.</p>
<h2>16. OUT THE BOX</h2>
<p>GYMBOX provide an on-demand platform, Out The Box, which is hosted by Uscreen, a third party provider. </p><p>One free Out The Box Subscription is included in a GYMBOX Membership, and is to be used only by that GYMBOX Member. All GYMBOX Members will be automatically enrolled, or will be given a discount code to apply and subscribe themselves. A GYMBOX Member must subscribe with the same email address that is linked to their GYMBOX Membership, which will also verify the discount. If the email address used for the Subscription does not match the GYMBOX Membership, access to the Out The Box platform may be removed.</p>
<p>Access to Out The Box for GYMBOX Members will automatically be removed when the corresponding GYMBOX Membership ends.</p>
<p>Non-GYMBOX Members may subscribe to a paid-for Out The Box Subscription. Out The Box Subscriptions renew automatically every month or year depending on the Subscription type chosen. Where payment is due for an Out The Box Subscription, this will be deducted from the card on file against that Subscriber. This will be deducted on the date of subscribing, and on that day each month/year thereafter until the Subscription is cancelled by the Subscriber.</p><p>To cancel an Out The Box Subscription for any reason, the Subscriber must head to the “Account Deets” section within the Out The Box login, select “Billing”, then “Change Plan” and there will show the option to “Cancel Membership”. This must be cancelled before the next payment date. Once cancelling, the Subscriber will have access to Out the Box until the end of their current billing period.</p>
<p>GYMBOX cannot refund any unused Subscriptions nor any payments where the Subscription is cancelled after the next payment date has already passed.</p>
<p>If at any point during a workout the Subscriber begins to feel faint, dizzy or have physical discomfort, GYMBOX advise the Subscriber to stop immediately and consult a medical professional.</p>
<p>GYMBOX does not accept the online registration of minors; please do not attempt to subscribe if you are under the age of 18.</p><p>Upon subscribing to Out The Box, GYMBOX may get in touch with the Subscriber about other GYMBOX things. For more information about data privacy at GYMBOX, please head to <a href="privacy-policy.html">GYMBOX Privacy Policy</a><br></p>

<h2>17. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>GYMBOX acknowledge that the security of a Members personal information is of high importance.

Should a Member wish to update their personal information and/or request a change of Membership, this must be requested using the registered email address within the GYMBOX database for that Member. Where GYMBOX is required to provide any written or email notification, GYMBOX will send the notice to the contact information on the Application Form, or any updated contact information the Member has provided since joining.
</p>

<p>(i) death or personal injury caused by its negligence, or the negligence of its personnel or agents;
</p>

<h2>20. THE TERMS OF YOUR CONTRACT</h2>
<p>A signed Application Form, these Terms & Conditions, the Club Rules and the PARQ make up a binding contract of Membership with GYMBOX. Members are advised to read the Terms & Conditions and Club Rules in full before signing the Application Form.
</p>
<p>The failure of GYMBOX to enforce any of its rights at any time for any period shall not be construed as a waiver of those rights. Any failure to identify or act upon a breach of the Terms & Conditions or Club Rules shall not be deemed to be an affirmation by GYMBOX that the behaviour of the Member or Guest is acceptable.
</p>
<p>Except where permitted by this Contract, neither GYMBOX nor the Member may alter the terms of this Contract without the express agreement of the other.</p>
<h2>21. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h2>
<p>These Terms & Conditions, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales.
</p>
<p>Each party irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms & Conditions or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).<br></p></div></div></div></div><footer class="_24zAESA _2rbE6TC _2v5bHvx"><div class="_2revefY _2rbE6TC _2v5bHvx _25LPQhk"><div class="p-HDv6u"><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span><span class="DGKlJgu">Book A Tour</span></div></div><div class="_1B_-c0t VBD7Ow3"><div class="_3sadWOc _2HhTmXD _2v5bHvx"><h3>Pages</h3><ul class="_1aeQHSW"><li><a class="_3FnoLbj _25LPQhk _2DGciQP" href="careers.html">Careers</a></li><li><a class="_3FnoLbj _25LPQhk _2DGciQP" href="member-services.html">Member Services</a></li><li><a class="_3FnoLbj _25LPQhk _2DGciQP" href="faqs.html">FAQs</a></li><li><a class="_3FnoLbj _25LPQhk _2DGciQP" href="refer.html">Refer a Friend</a></li><li><a class="_3FnoLbj _25LPQhk _2DGciQP" href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#34444651474774534d59565b4c1a575b1a415f">Press &amp;

A Member cannot switch to a Membership type with a shorter minimum term than their current contract. Any months completed on a previous Membership type will not be credited towards the minimum term of the new contract. A Member may only move onto a Membership type and rate available at the time of upgrading. These may vary from Membership types available at the Member\'s point of joining. </p>\\r\\n<h2>\\r\\n4. MEMBERSHIP CARD</h2>\\r\\n<p>A Membership card will be issued to each Member upon joining the Club. Members must present their card for security and verification on each visit to the Club; Members without a valid Membership card may be asked for photo identification, and will be admitted at the absolute discretion of GYMBOX staff.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>A Member may not loan their Membership card or permit its use by any other person; allowing such misuse of a Membership card may result in Membership being terminated with no refund of fees already paid.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>Any lost or mislaid Membership cards will be replaced by GYMBOX for a nominal charge. </p>\\r\\n<h2>5. INITIAL JOINING FEE AND MEMBERSHIP DUES</h2>\\r\\n<p>All Members shall pay an initial Joining Fee as per the Club\'s current price schedule, which will be made available to you before you join as a Member. The Joining Fee is not refundable under any circumstances.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>Membership is payable in advance, either fully or monthly as per the Membership type selected (see Point 3, above). Monthly fees will be debited on or around the 1st of each month. In the event that the Member falls into arrears in respect of any fees payable, all arrears must be settled before the Member can use the Club.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>Monthly Membership fees may be increased at the discretion of and at any time by GYMBOX, to take effect after the Member\'s minimum term subject to at least one calendar month\'s written notice.

If any Membership payment remains outstanding beyond the due date, the Member\'s signature on the Payment Guarantee constitutes the Member\'s unconditional and irrevocable authority to debit the nominated card for the total amount due without notice to the Member.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>GYMBOX reserves the right to levy an administration fee of £35 if it forwards the account to a 3rd party debt collection agency in the event of non-payment of fees when due. Any lapses in Membership, including but not limited to non-payment of fees or failure to renew a Paid in Full Membership, may result in a new Joining Fee being charged should the Member reapply for Membership.</p>\\r\\n<h2>6.

CANCELLING YOUR MEMBERSHIP</h2>\\r\\n<p>Members on a Monthly Minimum Term Membership contract may cancel their Membership after or with effect from the end of the minimum term, by giving one full calendar month\'s advance written notice, effective from the 1st of the following month. This should be done by completing a Cancellation Request using the GYMBOX Online Member Services function. This can be found on the GYMBOX website using the following link <a href=\\"member-services.html\\">http://gymbox.com/member-services</a>.<br></p>\\r\\n<p>A GYMBOX team member will respond to all cancellation requests. If confirmation of cancellation is not received, the Member is responsible for re-submitting the cancellation request.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>Where the payment method is Direct Debit, the Member must advise their bank to cancel the Direct Debit instruction after the final payment has been made. GYMBOX is not obliged to refund any fees where the Member has not cancelled the instruction and cannot provide proof of a valid cancellation request. All fees must be paid to date at the time of cancellation.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>Paid in Full Memberships will expire automatically at the end of the term, unless the Member chooses to renew their Membership. No refunds are applicable for any portion of fees paid upfront, excluding in the following circumstances: redundancy, permanent illness and permanent injury preventing gym usage. Valid documentation will be requested as proof in such circumstances.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>All Members who opt for a No Commitment Membership can terminate their Membership by cancelling the direct debit authorisation directly through their bank or building society. It is the Members responsibility to ensure enough notice is provided to the bank/building society to prevent the next payment. GYMBOX recommends at least 5 working days. Cancellations cannot be backdated and payments taken successfully will not be refunded. When a direct debit payment is unsuccessful, access will be denied with immediate effect and the Membership will be terminated within two working days. Should a Member wish to continue a Membership following a failed direct debit they may contact the membership team via <a href=\\"member-services.html\\">http://gymbox.com/member-services</a> to discuss available options.<br></p>\\r\\n<p>Should a Member be unable to use the Club for the remainder of the term, the Member may apply to transfer the Contract to another person. The Member is responsible for finding someone, who is not already a Member of a GYMBOX Club, to take over the balance of the Membership. A Transfer Fee will apply as per the Club\'s current price schedule. Both the existing Member (where possible) and the new Member must attend the Club to complete the transfer application, which will not be deemed complete until a Membership Application Form has been completed and signed by the new proposed Member and GYMBOX has accepted that person as a Member.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>Members still within the minimum contractual period may reduce their cancellation notice to one full calendar month in the following circumstances: Pregnancy, Redundancy, Permanent injury and Permanent illness preventing gym usage. Valid documentation will be requested as proof in such circumstances.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>Any Member with three or more months remaining of the minimum term may terminate their Membership at the end of the then current month by paying in full 50% of the total future fees due until the end of the minimum term.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>Please contact the GYMBOX membership team via the following link for more information: <a href=\\"member-services.html\\">http://gymbox.com/member-services</a>.</p>\\r\\n<h2>8. PRESALE - 14 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE</h2>\\r\\n<p>A \\"14 Day Money Back Guarantee\\" is applicable when a Member signs up to a new Club during its presale period. A presale period is defined as the time in which a Membership can be purchased for a new Club prior to the opening date.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>During the designated 14 days, a Member may request immediate termination of their new Membership, along with a refund of fees paid upon joining (including the joining fee).\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>The 14 days is effective from, and including, the agreed original start date of their Membership.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>A Member can only have a maximum of one visit of the new Club recorded on their Membership to be eligible for this 14 day money back offer. Upon visiting the facilities and using the new Club a second time, the member is confirming they will commit to the full terms of their chosen Membership.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>In cases where the Member has opted to use an existing GYMBOX site prior to the new location opening, the 14 day money back offer will not apply.</p>\\r\\n<h2>9. TRANSFERRING MEMBERSHIP TO ANOTHER CLUB </h2>\\r\\n<p>A Member can apply to move their Membership to another Club after the first four weeks of membership is complete. A price increase or package change may apply depending on the prevailing rate for their Membership at the requested Club.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h2>10. FREEZING YOUR MEMBERSHIP </h2>\\r\\n<p>Any Member may apply for their Membership to be frozen or unfrozen by completing a request via the GYMBOX Online Member Services function using the following link, <a href=\\"member-services.html\\">http://gymbox.com/member-services</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>The minimum freeze period is one full calendar month, commencing on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the month, with a maximum of six full consecutive calendar months.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>A Member must request the freeze by the 20<sup>th</sup> day of the month prior to the requested freeze start date. For example, a Member who wishes to freeze commencing 1<sup>st</sup> June, must complete the online request by 20<sup>th</sup> May. A freeze request completed on 21<sup>st</sup> May would only be eligible for a freeze start date as of 1<sup>st</sup> July.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>A fee of £15 per month applies throughout the period of frozen Membership. Freeze periods will not count towards a Member\'s contractual term, and will extend any applicable minimum term by the number of frozen months taken. Membership may not be frozen during the notice period of cancellation.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>Members on a Monthly contract type will have their freeze fee(s) taken via Direct Debit; Members on a Paid in Full contract type must settle their freeze fee(s) upfront in advance.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>Freezing for reasons of illness, injury or pregnancy will be reviewed and leniency may be applied in relation to the fee and notice period; valid medical documentation must be attached to the request for this to be considered. If valid dated documentation is provided, a freeze due to medical/injury reasons may be backdated, providing no usage has been registered on the Member’s account. In such circumstances no refund would be due and any fees paid would be credited to future Membership payments.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>Any Member who requests to freeze their Membership under the Terms and Conditions will not be able to access the Club during the frozen period, either via their Membership or purchase of a Guest Pass. A Member must apply to unfreeze their Membership if wishing to use the Club during the frozen period.

GYMBOX staff are not medically trained and are therefore not qualified to assess whether the Club user is in appropriate physical condition to use the facilities. GYMBOX advises all Club users to take medical advice prior to starting any exercise programme if they are in any doubt as to their ability to do so.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>The Member warrants and represents upon their Membership Application Form, and repeats such warranty upon each visit to the Club, that they are in good physical condition and know of no medical or other reason why they should not engage in any form of exercise, and that such exercise would not be detrimental to their health, safety, comfort or physical condition.</p>\\r\\n<h2>13. PERSONAL TRAINING</h2>\\r\\n<p>The Very Personal Trainers (VPT) that operate within Club are not employees of GYMBOX, but are self-employed, independent freelance trainers. In using a VPT you are entering into an agreement with the VPT alone and not with GYMBOX.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h2>14. RELOCATION OF A CLUB BY GYMBOX</h2>\\r\\n<p>GYMBOX may re-locate a Club, or open a new Club near to the Member\'s then current Club. In such case, GYMBOX may, on no less than 4 weeks\' written notice to the Member, notify the Member that the relocated Club or the new Club is to be the Club in respect of which the Member has their Membership.\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>a) If the re-located Club or new Club is one third of a mile or less from the Member\'s current Club, the Member\'s membership will automatically transfer to the re-located Club or new Club. In such case, all terms and conditions relating to the Member’s current membership will continue in full force and effect, applying to the relocated or new Club\\r\\n </p>\\r\\n<p>b) If the re-located Club or new Club is more than one third of a mile from the Member\'s current Club, and the Member does not agree to such relocation, the Member may terminate this Contract, effective on the date the Member’s current Club closes. In such cases GYMBOX will notify the Member of the relocation in writing, no less than 2 full calendar month’s in advance of the relocation date. The member must give one full calendar month’s advance notice, effective on the first of the following month, by completing a Cancellation Request using the GYMBOX online Member Services function. <a href=\\"member-services.html\\">http://gymbox.com/member-services</a>. Should the member accept the relocation, the member may, during the first 10 days of the new or relocated club opening, cancel their current contract with one full calendar months written notice. In such case, from the 11th day of the new club opening, all terms and conditions relating to the Member’s current membership will continue in full force and effect, applying to the relocated or new Club. </p>\\r\\n<h2>15.
