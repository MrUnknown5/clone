<h2>FIND ONLINE HIIT CLASSES AT GYMBOX</h2>
<p><strong>If there’s one thing you can rely on Gymbox for, it’s giving you the sweatiest sesh of your life. HIIT workouts generally combine short bursts of intense exercise with periods of rest or lower-intensity exercise. At fitness studios and online, these workouts often mix aerobic and resistance training. But with a whole range of HIIT classes spanning across a number of different categories, our new online platform brings our most torturous calorie-torching sessions wherever and whenever you want them, in the comfort of your own home.</strong>
</p>
<p>You may know Gymbox for its nightclub-inspired London locations, epic playlists and all-round party vibes. But with Out The Box, you’ll have access to a whole world of heart-racing, sweat-inducing, and totally unique online classes streamed to your TV, laptop, phone … or wherever you want to train.
</p>
<p>With fitness focused across five different categories, we pride ourselves on making sure there’s something for everyone, whenever they need it. But for those looking to send their pulse off the charts during a home workout, it’s the HIIT classes you’ll be wanting to look out for.
</p>
<p>Yes, if you’ve been looking for <a href="https://outthebox.gymbox.com/">online HIIT workout videos</a> to do in <a href="https://outthebox.gymbox.com/">your living room</a>, you’re in just the right place. Gymbox has been leading the way when it comes to creative classes since day one, and Out The Box gives you the same experience with London’s best fitness instructors, at the touch of a button.
</p>
<p>With new content being uploaded online every single week, you’re sure to find the right flow for you. Keep reading to find out more about our online HIIT classes, our amazing instructors and how you can sign up to Out The Box. But first, let’s get you better acquainted with London’s most exciting gym… Gymbox.</p></div></div></div><div class="_9QOA4oa"><div class="_2akYpU-"><div class="_2gpiPPm _12G1ncO"></div></div></div></div><div class="_2jiohKc _2_4LOuF _2rbE6TC _2v5bHvx VBD7Ow3"><div class="_1jUu-8N"><div class="_1QMkbpI"><div><p>Founded in 2003 in a worn-out West End car park, Gymbox has been a challenger of the status quo since day one. Setting out with a vision to disrupt the fitness industry, create unique training experiences and launch the most unique timetable the capital had ever seen, it’s a club known to be anything but your average kind of gym. It was among the first to introduce full-size boxing rings, nightly resident DJs, and led the way when it comes to kit.</p>
<p>To say Gymbox is EXTREMELY well equipped is a bit of an understatement. With state-of-the-art cardio equipment, stunning studio spaces, whopping free weights areas and super-clean changing rooms, members can’t get enough of the place. We’re constantly developing and evolving our huge timetable, welcoming in new concepts and styles within our Sweat class category and beyond. Now, we’re bringing the very best HIIT classes in London online, and we can’t wait to share them with you.
</p></div></div></div><div class="_9QOA4oa"><div class="_2akYpU-"><div class="_2gpiPPm _12G1ncO"></div></div></div></div><div class="_2_4LOuF _2rbE6TC _2v5bHvx VBD7Ow3"><div class="_1jUu-8N"><div class="_1QMkbpI"><div><h2><a href="https://outthebox.gymbox.com/">ONLINE HIIT CLASSES AT GYMBOX</a></h2>
<p>For those of you who judge their workouts by how hard they sweat, Gymbox will be your idea of heaven. With dedicated studio spaces for furiously intense classes, a huge frame to up your functional game and several other spaces all over the floor, there’s all sorts going on to get your heart rate up and your endorphins firing. We’ve got HIIT classes falling across a number of our categories – meaning there’s a different style of session whether you’re into cardio-heavy, weights-based or even combat training.
</p>
<p>What differentiates HIIT from the steady-state, continuous types of exercise — jogging at an even pace or walking, for example — is the intervals, those periods of heart-pounding intensity. If you want to try it, you can simply take a HIIT class, or run or even walk in a way that involves higher-speed and higher-incline bursts.
</p>
<p>If you want to get yourself fighting fit, then Killer Combat and Ultimate Fit provide circuit training HIIT sessions that’ll leave you in a real sweaty mess. If you just fancy jumping around til your muscles fail? Well, Escalate, Metcon or even Whiplash – our rope-based routine – should give you a hard HIIT of the good stuff. Or perhaps you’re looking for a HIIT workout to give you more focused results at home? If so, something like Hardcore or Badass might do the trick – targeting key muscle groups while putting your pores through hell.
</p>
<p>Out The Box is the latest addition to the Gymbox experience which means you can get your sweat on wherever you are – with plenty of our favourite yoga classes making it online for you to try out at home, whenever you like. But it doesn’t just stop there.
</p>
<p>With countless classes across five different categories, this online streaming platform gives you more choice than ever when it comes to working out. Just like the main clubs give you the feeling that ‘Anything Goes’, Gymbox’s online workout sessions give you the opportunity to try out all kinds of sessions in the comfort of your own home. So if you were too embarrassed to try Barre, lack confidence with your kettlebell technique, or just prefer to pump away in private, your next <a href="https://outthebox.gymbox.com/">online fitness class</a> hit is just one click away.
</p>
<p>We’ve been working hard on creating a platform that gives you a buzz just by logging in – with easy-to-navigate categories that makes finding your next class an absolute breeze. For a small monthly subscription fee of £10 a month, you can hang out with your favourite Gymbox instructors whenever and wherever you want – with more content dropping hot each and every week. The world may be feeling a little uncertain right now – but one thing’s for sure. With these online workouts bringing our sweatiest sessions to your own home, we’ve got your back when it comes to keeping up training. Because at Gymbox, we’re always raising the bar.

<p>As any Gymbox member will tell you, we pride ourselves on making our clubs as inclusive as possible. That means it doesn’t matter whether you’ve been hitting the gain train for a long time or if you’re completely new to working out – our classes are totally accessible to all.
</p>
<p>So what else makes our online HIIT sessions different from the rest? Well, when you start to explore the digital catalogue on Out The Box you’ll notice just how fun-focused and vibey our content is. Just like when you’re in club, we like to make sure you enjoy every minute of your workout. And for you HIIT lovers, we know that means creating an atmosphere and space to let go completely, putting your body through its paces and testing the limits of your fitness.
</p>
<p>Modern life has a way of making us feel time-crunched and pressured to find the most efficient ways of using the precious hours when we’re not sleeping. The trendy fitness regimen high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, epitomises this feeling. HIIT promises the best workout in the least amount of time. Runners have used interval training for more than 100 years, alternating between sprints and jogging to improve their endurance. But HIIT didn’t really go mainstream until about a decade ago, when exercise physiologists started to come out with study after study demonstrating that intervals could deliver the biggest health improvement for your exercise time.
</p>
<p>While we have a Sweat category which does what it says on the tin, you’ll find HIIT classes across a number of our categories online – with timetable favourites spanning conditioning to combat. As you probably know already, the whole point of HIIT is that you switch up the time that you work and rest, building on how long you keep going for endurance, or burning through shorter bursts for power. The intensity is always high, pushing you hard and demanding full efforts. But you still need to sustain it throughout.
</p>
<p>It’s a fine balance our instructors will have no problem in taking you through. And with new content being uploaded to Out The Box each and every week, you’ll have more online HIIT classes to access and keep every sesh fresh as you like. But first, we’d better introduce you to the classes on offer. Which one do you think you’ll be trying first…?</p>
<h4>Badass
</h4>
<p><strong><em>The name ain’t just for fun. You’re about to squeeze, squat, lift and burn your way through a class that whoops your ass to give you glutes of steel and thighs of iron. Get through this on the regular and it’s not just your butt that feels hard as nails.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>There are countless reasons why you should get in on a lower-body blitzer like this one. Whether it’s to increase your sports performance, get in shape or just improve your general mobility, strengthening your legs is a must. You could think of them as the support centre for your entire body – and by getting them working to full capacity will mean you’ll be bringing pretty much every other part of your motion in check.
</p>
<p>From your butt and thighs to your calves, Badass will give your lower body a full-scale battering in a class that blends weights with HIIT. Smashing every muscle, compound exercises (which are just the ticket for strength gain and weight loss) are paired with isolation and higher reps to boost your lactic acid build up which increases muscle.
</p>
<p>This is all about the largest muscle groups in your body, and we’re not going easy on them. Expect plenty of squats, lunges, donkey kicks, fire hydrants and deadlifts – all designed to up your strength and improve your form, as well as keep you safe from injury by forming a stable base. Give it a go online now!</p>
<h4>Drill Sergeant
</h4>
<p><strong><em>We won’t ask why you like a strict authoritarian crackdown on your training, you absolute sadist… but you’d better turn up ready to work. This is military fitness with no holds barred – hardcore circuits with a tongue-lashing pushing you over the finish line. It’s open to all levels of fitness, but don’t expect to stand at ease.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>All military fitness workouts are HIIT-based training. Why? Well, because it kicks your arse and keeps you on top form of course. The benefit with Drill Sergeant is that we’ve even brought in the barked commands and hard pushing you may expect from a real-life bootcamp… but it’s okay, because you’ll feel great at the end of it. (Promise.)
</p>
<p>Some of the best HIIT workouts are the ones with really simple moves. By not having to focus too much on complicated technique or instruction, you can throw your entire body into the task at hand… in this case, the sweatiest hell you’ll have ever encountered. With the added benefit of doing this particularly vicious HIIT workout at home, you can concentrate on giving every single movement everything you have, sending your body into new training zones where it will get fitter, stronger and start adapting too.
</p>
<p>With minimal equipment (except the bucketloads of grit and determination you’ll need to get through) this HIIT sesh is one that you can combat pretty much any time, anywhere – making it one of the most efficient, as well as effective ways to send your heart rate through the roof. As your pulse reaches somewhere in between 85-100% of your max during the peak of your work periods, this is a class that’ll not just get you to your maximum training zone. It’ll drag you there kicking and screaming. Give it a go online now! </p>
<h4>Escalate
</h4>
<p><strong><em>Functional, HIIT, circuits and track sprints? Ouch. If you’re looking for a class that’ll leave you knackered, aching and hilariously sweaty, you’ve hit the jackpot. Move from station to station as the intensity kicks up a gear each round. You'll wonder how things escalated so quickly.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Escalate is a 45 minute journey through the spiciest circuit training session of your life. The principle of circuit training is simple: you work through separate stations, taking on each exercise before moving on to the next. Of course, when we do this in studio, you’d move around the room and use various pieces of kit as well as the usual bodyweight burners. But with this online HIIT workout, you’ll tackle each move in your own home at your own pace… but don’t think you won’t still work hard!
</p>
<p>You may already be familiar with this type of training as it’s been around for a long time in various styles, forms and names. It’s a great way to get a full-body HIIT session that keeps you on your toes, with the variety meaning your body doesn’t ever get too used to any one movement. There’s so many different types of exercises that you can work into this kind of class that no one workout will ever be quite the same. But whether we get you cranking up your cardiovascular, resistance or high-intensity sprints, they’re brilliant for burning excess body fat (if that’s what you’re into, of course.)
</p>
<p>In an online session like Escalate, you can expect to improve your fitness, up your stamina and build muscle over time, as well as tone what you’ve already got. As the name suggests, your instructor will be upping the challenge on each and every round of the workout, meaning you’ll be pushing yourself harder with every rep. But what kind of reps are we talking here? Well, you might do things like bodyweight squats, push-ups, lunges, planks, high knees, mountain climbers, walkouts, triceps dips… and of course, BURPEES. If that hasn’t got your inner sadist going, nothing will. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a go online now!</p>
<h4>Hardcore
</h4>
<p><strong><em>This is also one mad assault on your middle that definitely earns that 6 pack. (And the one in the fridge.) Try the killer workout you crunch, twist and plank through to get there.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>You may be tempted to think that it’s only those with aspirations for washboard abs that can get into a workout like this. But here’s the thing. Pretty much every kind of mobility starts with your core. Having a strong and healthy middle is the secret to all kinds of everyday performance. Comprised of your back and hip muscles as well as your abdominals, this muscle group affects your balance, posture, stability – and with this online HIIT session, we’ll get your whole trunk on tip top form.
</p>
<p>Upper, lower, obliques, transverse… Hardcore is designed to hit every area of your core with challenging movements that strengthens, stabilises and supports your whole body. Every session picks and chooses from a set of movements that can be adapted for every level of fitness… and the more you do it, the better you’ll get. You might do bridges, crunches, hollow body holds, planks, toe taps, and almost every kind of sit up imaginable. Blended with rounds of more high-intensity, explosive movement, Hardcore will send your heart racing as well as giving your middle muscles some serious burn.
</p>
<p>The best thing about Hardcore is that you can take part in these online HIIT sessions pretty much anywhere in your home. With no equipment required apart from a mat, you can work this workout into your day whenever and wherever you want it. To build your core quickly but effectively, we’ll focus on a routine that touches all major core muscles, including the pelvic floor muscles, traverse abdominal muscles, erector spine muscles, and obliques.
</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, there are a million and one ways to work your core. So how can you decide what's best? Or just where to even start? As soon as you start doing it, you’ll soon find your own favourite core exercises. Most of them use only your bodyweight, so with Out The Box’s help, you can pick up new techniques and easily add them into your workout routine whether you're at home, in a gym, or traveling. Give it a go online now!</p>
<h4>Killer Combat
</h4>
<p><strong><em>If training montages have taught us anything, it’s that putting yourself through anaerobic hell is a the best way to win. Whether you’re kicking training up a few notches in prep for a fight or just like more workouts a bit tougher than most, try a combat circuit that would make even Rocky cry.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Combat conditioning circuits are a great way of working in bodyweight exercises that strengthen the muscles and movement your entire body. With this intense workout, we’re not just looking at improving what you see on the outside. The demanding HIIT of Killer Combat’s brutal moves mean you’re also boosting your lungs, heart and overall functional fitness. In a blinding blend of strength and cardio exercises, you’ll train every single part of your body, torching body fat, improving your flexibility and pushing your endurance to the absolute limit.
</p>
<p>As part of our Fight category, Killer Combat’s online sessions are based on the kind of conditioning drills prescribed to elite combat athletes – whether that’s boxing, Muay Thai or MMA. Generally speaking, circuit training can be used to progressively develop the muscular and circular respiratory systems. With its efficient use of time and variety of movements, these circuits can be used with a whole load of different exercises to get you on fighting form. When you combine that with punches, kicks and defensive movements usually associated with combat sports, you get yourself a head-to-toe conditioning sesh with the power to turn you into an absolute champ.
</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re usually more into weightlifting than HIIT style workouts. With the MMA and boxing influences at play in Killer Combat, you’ll discover the ultimate example of functional training – because you’ll be using your hips and core to maximize your leverage. The whole point of martial arts is to turn your entire body into a functional weapon. Success in MMA is dependent upon your ability to move your body fluidly. Everything you’ll learn through this combat conditioning workout will get you there. Give it a go online now!</p>
<h4>Metcon
</h4>
<p><strong><em>Short, quick and hotter than hell – there’s no messing about with MetCon. In just thirty minutes of solid HIIT, you’ll test your lung capacity and conquer your cardio quota like the endorphin-crazed machine you are. The no-nonsense way to walk in and crawl out.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Metabolic conditioning or “metcon” for short is a style of training made popular in recent years by the CrossFit community – although the style of training itself is nothing new. In this sweaty online HIIT, you’ll see that the term is actually used to describe the short bouts of higher-intensity training designed to increase metabolic demand and increase energy usage. Typically, metcon follows either a HIIT (high-intensity interval training) format with short periods of intense exercise followed by similar length at a lower intensity, or circuit training with various exercises performed back to back.
</p>
<p>It’s a broad style of workout, where 1 or more exercises are completed at a high intensity over a relatively longer period of time. Because of its wide definition, a Metcon can actually take many different forms. For example, a mile foot race, circuit class, spin class, or Tabata workout could all be Metcons. Essentially, any relatively high intensity workout with minimal break that lasts 10+ minutes could be considered a Metcon. In our spin on this old tried and tested formula, your Gymbox instructor will take you through a few rounds of spicy little movements, with the aim to keep building on your reps and strength each and every time.
</p>
<p>So who should give it a go? In a word, everybody. The best thing about a workout like this is that it is very adaptable and can be suited whatever your level of fitness. But as an exceptional all-rounder when it comes to exercise, it’s particularly good for anyone looking to get faster, stronger and focus on preventing injury. Metcon workouts recruit your body’s three metabolic systems (or pathways)—phosphagen, glycolytic, and oxidative – which all play a key role in how your body stores and uses up energy.
</p>
<p>Work-to-rest ratios of Metcon workouts depend on the workout itself and your own fitness level. Two popular types of Metcon workouts are AMRAPs (as many reps/rounds as possible) and EMOMs (every minute on the minute). During an AMRAP workout, you perform as many reps of each exercise or rounds of several exercises as you can during a predetermined amount of time. You’d rest as needed for this type of workout, so the work-to-rest ratio varies from person to person. Give it a go online!</p>
<h4>Reppin’
</h4>
<p><strong><em>When it comes to lifting, we don’t all like it heavy and slow. If it’s plenty of pumping and a cranked-up tempo that gets you going, these low-weight loads provide all the sweaty, sculpting, rep-fuelled rough n' tumble you need. It’s impossible to not look in the mirror and feel yourself after this.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Reppin’ is the online strength-based HIIT workout you’ll want to try at home now. This is resistance training with weights at its finest - it's a great way to burn calories and build muscle. Improving your muscles ultimately increases your metabolism, and can help you continue burning calories long after the class has finished.
</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this is all about highly repetitive movement, which is guaranteed to help you work up a sweat. The benefits cover your whole body and overall fitness, because as muscles repair from the workouts, your body's metabolism is increased. This means that calories are burned at an increased rate long after you finish your online class. With increased muscle mass, you'll use more energy, resulting in a greater rate of weight loss.
</p>
<p>The fun, total body workout helps you build lean, toned muscles through high numbers of reps. Using light weights and high repetitions, your Gymbox instructor will take you through movements that will help you get max results. Each workout is set up in muscle groups and are about 5 minutes each. Every time you switch muscle groups, you get a new song, and the rep count is set to the beat of the song.
</p>
<p>Since you’re lifting light weights for a ton of reps, you can expect your heart rate to go up and get a good calorie burn as well as strength training. It’s a different sort of workout than a cardio-heavy HIIT session, but the circuits you go through are every bit as effective. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a go online now!</p>
<h4>Sweat to the Beat
</h4>
<p><strong><em>Whether you’re a slave to the rhythm or addicted to bass, this catchy little conditioning class is guaranteed to get peak fitness pouring from every pore. This is bodyweight endurance to a beat, challenging your strength, sculpting your figure and making music pulse through every muscle. The floor is yours.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Sweat to the Beat is the HIIT workout based on dance conditioning – pushing you to the peak physical fitness levels that any performer would be proud of. Don’t worry if you’ve got two left feet. The kind of moves we’ll be putting you through are something anybody can do – but they’re sure to challenge your strength, flexibility and endurance.
</p>
<p>Often the aim of cardio training for dancers is to increase endurance, or to reduce body without increasing muscle bulk. However there are many other benefits to a good cardio program, and it should be an essential element of any dancers training regime, no matter what their body type. As injury rates increase with fatigue, potentially improving a dancer's endurance may help prevent many of those injuries occurring.
</p>
<p>Interval training is a super effective way for dancers to increase their endurance and fitness. There are many studies that outline the usefulness of this method and theoretically is most similar to how dancers perform. Sweat to the Beat takes those principles and packs it into a fun, three-part class that targets key areas of your body: lower body, core strength and a full-own cardio-crazed finisher. As the name suggests, you’re going to find yourself in quite a puddle when you’re finally done. But with great fun and banging beats to keep you focused, this is a workout that you won’t be able to get enough of. Give it a go online now!</p>
<h4>Swingers
</h4>
<p><strong><em>Swap your same-old cardio routine for a group session that'll really test your stamina. Working you hard from top to toe, this kettlebell swing circuit builds power and shreds fat while the energy in the studio reaches boiling point. Hold tight because things are about to get seriously steamy.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Kettlebells are one of the hottest pieces of equipment a gym goer can get their hands on – and there are so many reasons why. Whether you’re using them to swing or try a Turkish get-up, this versatile kit is a great addition to so many different movements, from squats and lunges to all kinds of upper body moves. The way you hold the weight means you naturally engage your core better, meaning you’ll build strength from head to toe.
</p>
<p>Kettlebells are nothing new in the world of fitness. Folklore has it that kettlebells were first used as counterweights in Russian markets, and at the end of the day the farmers would swing, toss, and juggle the weights for fun and exercise. The kettlebell swing we do today is a variation of the traditional Russian kettlebell swing, which is shorter—but it’s still just as awesome as it was hundreds of years ago. If you were looking for the single perfect exercise—one that would not only burn a ton of calories, scorch fat, build muscle, boost your endurance, as well as improve your posture and keep you from getting low back pain—you’d need to look no further than the kettlebell swing.
</p>
<p>Swingers is an online HIIT workout that puts both you and your heart rate through their paces. Kettlebells can be used for strength, endurance, flexibility and balance training…the four main aspects of fitness. This is definitely one of the biggest benefits of kettlebells. Without a doubt, they are one of the best tools for a truly effective, result-achieving, safe, full-body conditioning session. This class is all about using them to build your ballistic strength and endurance – in simple terms, the explosive movements you create with this blend of acceleration and deceleration.
</p>
<p>By doing this, you’ll be working up a hard sweat while also working your core from all directions. This is an absolute must when it comes to building well-rounded strength. Every movement is very dynamic, meaning you’ll become highly aware of your body and form. This means creating a stronger connection between your mind and your muscles – boosting ability as well as firing up your fat burn. Say goodbye to long old slogs on the treadmill. Give it a go online now! </p>
<h4>Ultimate Fit
</h4>
<p><strong><em>If you thought that any class with ‘ultimate’ in the name is going to give you a workout so tough that your eyeballs sweat, you’d be 100% correct. Fast-paced, high-intensity and MMA inspired, these are conditioning fitness drills for combat fans who like to kick their own a** before their opponent’s.</em></strong>
</p>

<h4>WOD Squad
</h4>
<p><strong><em>Pulling, pushing, climbing, lifting. Seems so simple, doesn’t it? Well, looks can be deceiving, pal. Being a Gymbox workout, you’ll mix up those four functional movements to give your body a good hiding; testing your strength, building your skills as well as an intense sweat. It’s fitness at its finest if you dig the rig.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>What is a WOD? The Workout of the Day of course – and this online HIIT session is the one that’ll give you expert programming and a super-sweaty sesh to keep your training as fresh as possible. Inspired by Crossfit, it combines elements of cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy, using a combination of fast-paced functional movements, Olympic lifts, and gymnastics.
</p>
<p>Although Crossfit combines many other elements, one of the key characteristics is a daily workout, hence the “workout of the day”. These are either done “AMRAP” (see below for definition) in a certain amount of time; or complete a circuit as fast as possible. There are all kinds of reasons that building this kind of exercise into your daily routine can be of great benefit – and with the WOD Squad workouts on Out The Box, you’ll have access to some of the best online HIIT training to give you a head-to-toe transformation.
</p>
<p>Cardio and strength training can both give you a lift, and 30 to 60 minutes of exercise three to five days a week is optimal for mood benefits, according to the U.S. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Most WOD workouts will include some weightlifting, and lifting weights doesn't just torch calories mid-workout, but after it too. That's because your muscle mass is one of the main determining factors of your metabolic rate-how many calories you burn just by living. More muscle mass means a faster metabolism – and that means burning more calories all day long.
</p>
<p>There's also the "afterburn effect" (also known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption or EPOC) which says that the more intense the exercise is, the more oxygen your body consumes afterward, and therefore the more calories you burn even after you've left the gym. WODs themselves are usually only three to 20 minutes long. Seriously! (The rest of the class includes a warm-up, a cool-down, and sometimes an additional weightlifting portion.) With that in mind, it’s safe to say that WODs are actually one of the time-efficient workouts around, with short bouts of HIIT helping to boost cardiovascular fitness.</p>
<h4>Whiplash
</h4>
<p><strong><em>It may be skipping but there’s no playtime here. Progress your rope technique, crack your footwork co-ordination and work up one hell of a sweat as all your Rocky training montage dreams come true. We weren’t lying when we said we’d whip you into shape.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Okay, so this one might require investing in a piece of equipment. But for the sake of a few pounds, buying yourself a skipping rope may be the first step towards one of the best at home HIIT sessions your body has ever experienced! Should your fitness goals involve anything to do with cardiovascular improvement and max calorie blitz, skipping as a form of exercise could be one of the most beneficial things you can try. Whiplash is Out The Box’s very own jump rope session that’s set to put you through your paces – whether you’re a wannabe boxer or you’ve just got energy to burn.
</p>
<p>Skipping is a fantastic method for training power, speed and endurance, with key benefits for ankle, pelvic and knee stability. And if you're on a journey to a body transformation then adding skipping into your week could help jump start your results. In fact, skipping is one of the most efficient exercises out there; a study in Research Quarterly For Exercise And Sport found that skipping for 10 minutes a day delivered the same cardiovascular benefits over six weeks as jogging daily for 30 minutes. As a full-body form of exercise, you end up incorporating your arms and shoulders every bit as much as your lower body muscles – helping out poor posture by forcing you to hold your shoulders back.
</p>
<p>The endurance element isn’t something to be sniffed at either. Unlike many other forms of exercise, the only thing between you and skipping success is you. Our instructors can help guide and engage you throughout your online Whiplash session. But ultimately, your brain has to be fully on the ball to keep your grip on this physically challenging and repetitive practice working at full capacity. Just remember, if you're looking to push your calorie burning, fat-busting HIIT workouts to the next level, you should start skipping. Skipping rope is one of the most effective cardio exercises around, per a study that found just 10 minutes a day with the rope was comparable to 30 minutes of jogging. Experts tout the activity's benefits as a certifiable full body workout that promotes good heart health, too. Give it a go online now!

With dedicated studio spaces for furiously intense classes, a huge frame to up your functional game and several other spaces all over the floor, there’s all sorts going on to get your heart rate up and your endorphins firing. We’ve got HIIT classes falling across a number of our categories – meaning there’s a different style of session whether you’re into cardio-heavy, weights-based or even combat training.\\n</p>\\n<p>What differentiates HIIT from the steady-state, continuous types of exercise — jogging at an even pace or walking, for example — is the intervals, those periods of heart-pounding intensity. If you want to try it, you can simply take a HIIT class, or run or even walk in a way that involves higher-speed and higher-incline bursts.\\n</p>\\n<p>If you want to get yourself fighting fit, then Killer Combat and Ultimate Fit provide circuit training HIIT sessions that’ll leave you in a real sweaty mess. If you just fancy jumping around til your muscles fail? Well, Escalate, Metcon or even Whiplash – our rope-based routine – should give you a hard HIIT of the good stuff. Or perhaps you’re looking for a HIIT workout to give you more focused results at home? If so, something like Hardcore or Badass might do the trick – targeting key muscle groups while putting your pores through hell.\\n</p>\\n<p>Out The Box is the latest addition to the Gymbox experience which means you can get your sweat on wherever you are – with plenty of our favourite yoga classes making it online for you to try out at home, whenever you like.

That means it doesn’t matter whether you’ve been hitting the gain train for a long time or if you’re completely new to working out – our classes are totally accessible to all.\\n</p>\\n<p>So what else makes our online HIIT sessions different from the rest? Well, when you start to explore the digital catalogue on Out The Box you’ll notice just how fun-focused and vibey our content is. Just like when you’re in club, we like to make sure you enjoy every minute of your workout. And for you HIIT lovers, we know that means creating an atmosphere and space to let go completely, putting your body through its paces and testing the limits of your fitness.\\n</p>\\n<p>Modern life has a way of making us feel time-crunched and pressured to find the most efficient ways of using the precious hours when we’re not sleeping. The trendy fitness regimen high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, epitomises this feeling. HIIT promises the best workout in the least amount of time. Runners have used interval training for more than 100 years, alternating between sprints and jogging to improve their endurance. But HIIT didn’t really go mainstream until about a decade ago, when exercise physiologists started to come out with study after study demonstrating that intervals could deliver the biggest health improvement for your exercise time.\\n</p>\\n<p>While we have a Sweat category which does what it says on the tin, you’ll find HIIT classes across a number of our categories online – with timetable favourites spanning conditioning to combat. As you probably know already, the whole point of HIIT is that you switch up the time that you work and rest, building on how long you keep going for endurance, or burning through shorter bursts for power. The intensity is always high, pushing you hard and demanding full efforts. But you still need to sustain it throughout.\\n</p>\\n<p>It’s a fine balance our instructors will have no problem in taking you through. And with new content being uploaded to Out The Box each and every week, you’ll have more online HIIT classes to access and keep every sesh fresh as you like. But first, we’d better introduce you to the classes on offer. Which one do you think you’ll be trying first…?</p>\\n<h4>Badass\\n</h4>\\n<p><strong><em>The name ain’t just for fun. You’re about to squeeze, squat, lift and burn your way through a class that whoops your ass to give you glutes of steel and thighs of iron. Get through this on the regular and it’s not just your butt that feels hard as nails.</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>There are countless reasons why you should get in on a lower-body blitzer like this one. Whether it’s to increase your sports performance, get in shape or just improve your general mobility, strengthening your legs is a must. You could think of them as the support centre for your entire body – and by getting them working to full capacity will mean you’ll be bringing pretty much every other part of your motion in check.\\n</p>\\n<p>From your butt and thighs to your calves, Badass will give your lower body a full-scale battering in a class that blends weights with HIIT. Smashing every muscle, compound exercises (which are just the ticket for strength gain and weight loss) are paired with isolation and higher reps to boost your lactic acid build up which increases muscle.\\n</p>\\n<p>This is all about the largest muscle groups in your body, and we’re not going easy on them. Expect plenty of squats, lunges, donkey kicks, fire hydrants and deadlifts – all designed to up your strength and improve your form, as well as keep you safe from injury by forming a stable base. Give it a go online now!</p>\\n<h4>Drill Sergeant\\n</h4>\\n<p><strong><em>We won’t ask why you like a strict authoritarian crackdown on your training, you absolute sadist… but you’d better turn up ready to work. This is military fitness with no holds barred – hardcore circuits with a tongue-lashing pushing you over the finish line. It’s open to all levels of fitness, but don’t expect to stand at ease.</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>All military fitness workouts are HIIT-based training. Why? Well, because it kicks your arse and keeps you on top form of course. The benefit with Drill Sergeant is that we’ve even brought in the barked commands and hard pushing you may expect from a real-life bootcamp… but it’s okay, because you’ll feel great at the end of it. (Promise.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Some of the best HIIT workouts are the ones with really simple moves. By not having to focus too much on complicated technique or instruction, you can throw your entire body into the task at hand… in this case, the sweatiest hell you’ll have ever encountered. With the added benefit of doing this particularly vicious HIIT workout at home, you can concentrate on giving every single movement everything you have, sending your body into new training zones where it will get fitter, stronger and start adapting too.\\n</p>\\n<p>With minimal equipment (except the bucketloads of grit and determination you’ll need to get through) this HIIT sesh is one that you can combat pretty much any time, anywhere – making it one of the most efficient, as well as effective ways to send your heart rate through the roof. As your pulse reaches somewhere in between 85-100% of your max during the peak of your work periods, this is a class that’ll not just get you to your maximum training zone. It’ll drag you there kicking and screaming. Give it a go online now! </p>\\n<h4>Escalate\\n</h4>\\n<p><strong><em>Functional, HIIT, circuits and track sprints? Ouch. If you’re looking for a class that’ll leave you knackered, aching and hilariously sweaty, you’ve hit the jackpot. Move from station to station as the intensity kicks up a gear each round. You\'ll wonder how things escalated so quickly.</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>In a nutshell, Escalate is a 45 minute journey through the spiciest circuit training session of your life. The principle of circuit training is simple: you work through separate stations, taking on each exercise before moving on to the next. Of course, when we do this in studio, you’d move around the room and use various pieces of kit as well as the usual bodyweight burners. But with this online HIIT workout, you’ll tackle each move in your own home at your own pace… but don’t think you won’t still work hard!\\n</p>\\n<p>You may already be familiar with this type of training as it’s been around for a long time in various styles, forms and names. It’s a great way to get a full-body HIIT session that keeps you on your toes, with the variety meaning your body doesn’t ever get too used to any one movement. There’s so many different types of exercises that you can work into this kind of class that no one workout will ever be quite the same. But whether we get you cranking up your cardiovascular, resistance or high-intensity sprints, they’re brilliant for burning excess body fat (if that’s what you’re into, of course.)\\n</p>\\n<p>In an online session like Escalate, you can expect to improve your fitness, up your stamina and build muscle over time, as well as tone what you’ve already got. As the name suggests, your instructor will be upping the challenge on each and every round of the workout, meaning you’ll be pushing yourself harder with every rep. But what kind of reps are we talking here? Well, you might do things like bodyweight squats, push-ups, lunges, planks, high knees, mountain climbers, walkouts, triceps dips… and of course, BURPEES. If that hasn’t got your inner sadist going, nothing will. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a go online now!</p>\\n<h4>Hardcore\\n</h4>\\n<p><strong><em>This is also one mad assault on your middle that definitely earns that 6 pack. (And the one in the fridge.) Try the killer workout you crunch, twist and plank through to get there.</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>You may be tempted to think that it’s only those with aspirations for washboard abs that can get into a workout like this. But here’s the thing. Pretty much every kind of mobility starts with your core. Having a strong and healthy middle is the secret to all kinds of everyday performance. Comprised of your back and hip muscles as well as your abdominals, this muscle group affects your balance, posture, stability – and with this online HIIT session, we’ll get your whole trunk on tip top form.\\n</p>\\n<p>Upper, lower, obliques, transverse… Hardcore is designed to hit every area of your core with challenging movements that strengthens, stabilises and supports your whole body. Every session picks and chooses from a set of movements that can be adapted for every level of fitness… and the more you do it, the better you’ll get. You might do bridges, crunches, hollow body holds, planks, toe taps, and almost every kind of sit up imaginable. Blended with rounds of more high-intensity, explosive movement, Hardcore will send your heart racing as well as giving your middle muscles some serious burn.\\n</p>\\n<p>The best thing about Hardcore is that you can take part in these online HIIT sessions pretty much anywhere in your home. With no equipment required apart from a mat, you can work this workout into your day whenever and wherever you want it. To build your core quickly but effectively, we’ll focus on a routine that touches all major core muscles, including the pelvic floor muscles, traverse abdominal muscles, erector spine muscles, and obliques.\\n</p>\\n<p>When it comes down to it, there are a million and one ways to work your core. So how can you decide what\'s best? Or just where to even start? As soon as you start doing it, you’ll soon find your own favourite core exercises. Most of them use only your bodyweight, so with Out The Box’s help, you can pick up new techniques and easily add them into your workout routine whether you\'re at home, in a gym, or traveling. Give it a go online now!</p>\\n<h4>Killer Combat\\n</h4>\\n<p><strong><em>If training montages have taught us anything, it’s that putting yourself through anaerobic hell is a the best way to win. Whether you’re kicking training up a few notches in prep for a fight or just like more workouts a bit tougher than most, try a combat circuit that would make even Rocky cry.</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>Combat conditioning circuits are a great way of working in bodyweight exercises that strengthen the muscles and movement your entire body. With this intense workout, we’re not just looking at improving what you see on the outside. The demanding HIIT of Killer Combat’s brutal moves mean you’re also boosting your lungs, heart and overall functional fitness. In a blinding blend of strength and cardio exercises, you’ll train every single part of your body, torching body fat, improving your flexibility and pushing your endurance to the absolute limit.\\n</p>\\n<p>As part of our Fight category, Killer Combat’s online sessions are based on the kind of conditioning drills prescribed to elite combat athletes – whether that’s boxing, Muay Thai or MMA. Generally speaking, circuit training can be used to progressively develop the muscular and circular respiratory systems. With its efficient use of time and variety of movements, these circuits can be used with a whole load of different exercises to get you on fighting form. When you combine that with punches, kicks and defensive movements usually associated with combat sports, you get yourself a head-to-toe conditioning sesh with the power to turn you into an absolute champ.\\n</p>\\n<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re usually more into weightlifting than HIIT style workouts. With the MMA and boxing influences at play in Killer Combat, you’ll discover the ultimate example of functional training – because you’ll be using your hips and core to maximize your leverage. The whole point of martial arts is to turn your entire body into a functional weapon. Success in MMA is dependent upon your ability to move your body fluidly. Everything you’ll learn through this combat conditioning workout will get you there. Give it a go online now!</p>\\n<h4>Metcon\\n</h4>\\n<p><strong><em>Short, quick and hotter than hell – there’s no messing about with MetCon. In just thirty minutes of solid HIIT, you’ll test your lung capacity and conquer your cardio quota like the endorphin-crazed machine you are. The no-nonsense way to walk in and crawl out.</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>Metabolic conditioning or “metcon” for short is a style of training made popular in recent years by the CrossFit community – although the style of training itself is nothing new. In this sweaty online HIIT, you’ll see that the term is actually used to describe the short bouts of higher-intensity training designed to increase metabolic demand and increase energy usage. Typically, metcon follows either a HIIT (high-intensity interval training) format with short periods of intense exercise followed by similar length at a lower intensity, or circuit training with various exercises performed back to back.\\n</p>\\n<p>It’s a broad style of workout, where 1 or more exercises are completed at a high intensity over a relatively longer period of time. Because of its wide definition, a Metcon can actually take many different forms. For example, a mile foot race, circuit class, spin class, or Tabata workout could all be Metcons. Essentially, any relatively high intensity workout with minimal break that lasts 10+ minutes could be considered a Metcon. In our spin on this old tried and tested formula, your Gymbox instructor will take you through a few rounds of spicy little movements, with the aim to keep building on your reps and strength each and every time.\\n</p>\\n<p>So who should give it a go? In a word, everybody. The best thing about a workout like this is that it is very adaptable and can be suited whatever your level of fitness. But as an exceptional all-rounder when it comes to exercise, it’s particularly good for anyone looking to get faster, stronger and focus on preventing injury. Metcon workouts recruit your body’s three metabolic systems (or pathways)—phosphagen, glycolytic, and oxidative – which all play a key role in how your body stores and uses up energy.\\n</p>\\n<p>Work-to-rest ratios of Metcon workouts depend on the workout itself and your own fitness level. Two popular types of Metcon workouts are AMRAPs (as many reps/rounds as possible) and EMOMs (every minute on the minute). During an AMRAP workout, you perform as many reps of each exercise or rounds of several exercises as you can during a predetermined amount of time. You’d rest as needed for this type of workout, so the work-to-rest ratio varies from person to person. Give it a go online!</p>\\n<h4>Reppin’\\n</h4>\\n<p><strong><em>When it comes to lifting, we don’t all like it heavy and slow. If it’s plenty of pumping and a cranked-up tempo that gets you going, these low-weight loads provide all the sweaty, sculpting, rep-fuelled rough n\' tumble you need. It’s impossible to not look in the mirror and feel yourself after this.</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>Reppin’ is the online strength-based HIIT workout you’ll want to try at home now. This is resistance training with weights at its finest - it\'s a great way to burn calories and build muscle. Improving your muscles ultimately increases your metabolism, and can help you continue burning calories long after the class has finished.\\n</p>\\n<p>As the name suggests, this is all about highly repetitive movement, which is guaranteed to help you work up a sweat. The benefits cover your whole body and overall fitness, because as muscles repair from the workouts, your body\'s metabolism is increased. This means that calories are burned at an increased rate long after you finish your online class. With increased muscle mass, you\'ll use more energy, resulting in a greater rate of weight loss.\\n</p>\\n<p>The fun, total body workout helps you build lean, toned muscles through high numbers of reps. Using light weights and high repetitions, your Gymbox instructor will take you through movements that will help you get max results. Each workout is set up in muscle groups and are about 5 minutes each. Every time you switch muscle groups, you get a new song, and the rep count is set to the beat of the song.\\n</p>\\n<p>Since you’re lifting light weights for a ton of reps, you can expect your heart rate to go up and get a good calorie burn as well as strength training. It’s a different sort of workout than a cardio-heavy HIIT session, but the circuits you go through are every bit as effective. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a go online now!</p>\\n<h4>Sweat to the Beat\\n</h4>\\n<p><strong><em>Whether you’re a slave to the rhythm or addicted to bass, this catchy little conditioning class is guaranteed to get peak fitness pouring from every pore. This is bodyweight endurance to a beat, challenging your strength, sculpting your figure and making music pulse through every muscle. The floor is yours.</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>Sweat to the Beat is the HIIT workout based on dance conditioning – pushing you to the peak physical fitness levels that any performer would be proud of. Don’t worry if you’ve got two left feet. The kind of moves we’ll be putting you through are something anybody can do – but they’re sure to challenge your strength, flexibility and endurance. \\n</p>\\n<p>Often the aim of cardio training for dancers is to increase endurance, or to reduce body without increasing muscle bulk. However there are many other benefits to a good cardio program, and it should be an essential element of any dancers training regime, no matter what their body type. As injury rates increase with fatigue, potentially improving a dancer\'s endurance may help prevent many of those injuries occurring.\\n</p>\\n<p>Interval training is a super effective way for dancers to increase their endurance and fitness. There are many studies that outline the usefulness of this method and theoretically is most similar to how dancers perform. Sweat to the Beat takes those principles and packs it into a fun, three-part class that targets key areas of your body: lower body, core strength and a full-own cardio-crazed finisher. As the name suggests, you’re going to find yourself in quite a puddle when you’re finally done. But with great fun and banging beats to keep you focused, this is a workout that you won’t be able to get enough of. Give it a go online now!</p>\\n<h4>Swingers\\n</h4>\\n<p><strong><em>Swap your same-old cardio routine for a group session that\'ll really test your stamina. Working you hard from top to toe, this kettlebell swing circuit builds power and shreds fat while the energy in the studio reaches boiling point. Hold tight because things are about to get seriously steamy.</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>Kettlebells are one of the hottest pieces of equipment a gym goer can get their hands on – and there are so many reasons why. Whether you’re using them to swing or try a Turkish get-up, this versatile kit is a great addition to so many different movements, from squats and lunges to all kinds of upper body moves. The way you hold the weight means you naturally engage your core better, meaning you’ll build strength from head to toe.\\n</p>\\n<p>Kettlebells are nothing new in the world of fitness. Folklore has it that kettlebells were first used as counterweights in Russian markets, and at the end of the day the farmers would swing, toss, and juggle the weights for fun and exercise. The kettlebell swing we do today is a variation of the traditional Russian kettlebell swing, which is shorter—but it’s still just as awesome as it was hundreds of years ago. If you were looking for the single perfect exercise—one that would not only burn a ton of calories, scorch fat, build muscle, boost your endurance, as well as improve your posture and keep you from getting low back pain—you’d need to look no further than the kettlebell swing.\\n</p>\\n<p>Swingers is an online HIIT workout that puts both you and your heart rate through their paces. Kettlebells can be used for strength, endurance, flexibility and balance training…the four main aspects of fitness. This is definitely one of the biggest benefits of kettlebells. Without a doubt, they are one of the best tools for a truly effective, result-achieving, safe, full-body conditioning session. This class is all about using them to build your ballistic strength and endurance – in simple terms, the explosive movements you create with this blend of acceleration and deceleration.\\n</p>\\n<p>By doing this, you’ll be working up a hard sweat while also working your core from all directions. This is an absolute must when it comes to building well-rounded strength. Every movement is very dynamic, meaning you’ll become highly aware of your body and form. This means creating a stronger connection between your mind and your muscles – boosting ability as well as firing up your fat burn. Say goodbye to long old slogs on the treadmill. Give it a go online now! </p>\\n<h4>Ultimate Fit\\n</h4>\\n<p><strong><em>If you thought that any class with ‘ultimate’ in the name is going to give you a workout so tough that your eyeballs sweat, you’d be 100% correct.

Seems so simple, doesn’t it? Well, looks can be deceiving, pal. Being a Gymbox workout, you’ll mix up those four functional movements to give your body a good hiding; testing your strength, building your skills as well as an intense sweat. It’s fitness at its finest if you dig the rig.</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>What is a WOD? The Workout of the Day of course – and this online HIIT session is the one that’ll give you expert programming and a super-sweaty sesh to keep your training as fresh as possible. Inspired by Crossfit, it combines elements of cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy, using a combination of fast-paced functional movements, Olympic lifts, and gymnastics.\\n</p>\\n<p>Although Crossfit combines many other elements, one of the key characteristics is a daily workout, hence the “workout of the day”. These are either done “AMRAP” (see below for definition) in a certain amount of time; or complete a circuit as fast as possible. There are all kinds of reasons that building this kind of exercise into your daily routine can be of great benefit – and with the WOD Squad workouts on Out The Box, you’ll have access to some of the best online HIIT training to give you a head-to-toe transformation.\\n</p>\\n<p>Cardio and strength training can both give you a lift, and 30 to 60 minutes of exercise three to five days a week is optimal for mood benefits, according to the U.S. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Most WOD workouts will include some weightlifting, and lifting weights doesn\'t just torch calories mid-workout, but after it too. That\'s because your muscle mass is one of the main determining factors of your metabolic rate-how many calories you burn just by living. More muscle mass means a faster metabolism – and that means burning more calories all day long.\\n</p>\\n<p>There\'s also the \\"afterburn effect\\" (also known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption or EPOC) which says that the more intense the exercise is, the more oxygen your body consumes afterward, and therefore the more calories you burn even after you\'ve left the gym. WODs themselves are usually only three to 20 minutes long. Seriously! (The rest of the class includes a warm-up, a cool-down, and sometimes an additional weightlifting portion.) With that in mind, it’s safe to say that WODs are actually one of the time-efficient workouts around, with short bouts of HIIT helping to boost cardiovascular fitness.</p>\\n<h4>Whiplash\\n</h4>\\n<p><strong><em>It may be skipping but there’s no playtime here. Progress your rope technique, crack your footwork co-ordination and work up one hell of a sweat as all your Rocky training montage dreams come true. We weren’t lying when we said we’d whip you into shape.</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>Okay, so this one might require investing in a piece of equipment. But for the sake of a few pounds, buying yourself a skipping rope may be the first step towards one of the best at home HIIT sessions your body has ever experienced! Should your fitness goals involve anything to do with cardiovascular improvement and max calorie blitz, skipping as a form of exercise could be one of the most beneficial things you can try. Whiplash is Out The Box’s very own jump rope session that’s set to put you through your paces – whether you’re a wannabe boxer or you’ve just got energy to burn.\\n</p>\\n<p>Skipping is a fantastic method for training power, speed and endurance, with key benefits for ankle, pelvic and knee stability. And if you\'re on a journey to a body transformation then adding skipping into your week could help jump start your results. In fact, skipping is one of the most efficient exercises out there; a study in Research Quarterly For Exercise And Sport found that skipping for 10 minutes a day delivered the same cardiovascular benefits over six weeks as jogging daily for 30 minutes. As a full-body form of exercise, you end up incorporating your arms and shoulders every bit as much as your lower body muscles – helping out poor posture by forcing you to hold your shoulders back.\\n</p>\\n<p>The endurance element isn’t something to be sniffed at either. Unlike many other forms of exercise, the only thing between you and skipping success is you. Our instructors can help guide and engage you throughout your online Whiplash session. But ultimately, your brain has to be fully on the ball to keep your grip on this physically challenging and repetitive practice working at full capacity. Just remember, if you\'re looking to push your calorie burning, fat-busting HIIT workouts to the next level, you should start skipping. Skipping rope is one of the most effective cardio exercises around, per a study that found just 10 minutes a day with the rope was comparable to 30 minutes of jogging. Experts tout the activity\'s benefits as a certifiable full body workout that promotes good heart health, too.
