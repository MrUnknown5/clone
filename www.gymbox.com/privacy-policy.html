<h4>6. Keeping your Information Secure</h4>
<p>In regards to environmental and physical security, all GYMBOX employees receive full training upon commencement on employment and subsequently on an annual basis thereafter. This is completed via an e-learning platform and group training sessions. Further to this, daily, weekly and monthly audits are completed.</p>
<h4><strong>7. GYMBOX Retention Policies</strong></h4>
<p>GYMBOX have set company retention policies in place and these timescales are set in accordance with any applicable legislation and/or for any agreed legitimate reasons. Where none exists, then GYMBOX will keep your information for the duration of any Contract that you have entered into with GYMBOX, and then for a period of 7 years after, at which time all the personal information will be pseudonymised.</p>
<p> After that 7 year duration, GYMBOX will retain and use your pseudonymised information for the purpose of business statistics and analysis. GYMBOX can retract this pseudonymisation to the extent necessary to comply with any legal obligations or to resolve disputes</p>
<h4>8. Staying in Control - Your Rights</h4>
<p>GYMBOX understand the importance of data subjects remaining in control of their personal data. GYMBOX acknowledge the following rights you have under the GDPR, what they mean and how you can exercise them.</p>
<p>
<strong>The Right to be Informed</strong>
</p>
<p>This privacy policy states all uses of your personal information and the purposes for processing this information. Should you have any concerns or questions about our privacy policy and practices, or would like a full list of our third party processors, then please email <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#bed3c7cedbcccdd1d0dfd2dadfcadffed9c7d3dcd1c690ddd190cbd5"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="204d59504552534f4e414c444154416047594d424f580e434f0e554b">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> </p>
<p><strong>The Right of Access</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to access information that GYMBOX hold about you. If you wish to receive a copy of the information that GYMBOX hold, please submit a Subject Access Request form (SAR) which you can request from <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#c8a5b1b8adbabba7a6a9a4aca9bca988afb1a5aaa7b0e6aba7e6bda3"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="711c08011403021e1f101d151005103116081c131e095f121e5f041a">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Once GYMBOX have received your form, they will provide a response within one month. If your request is unusually complex and likely to take longer than a month, you will be informed as soon as possible to tell you how long it’s likely to take.
</p>
<p>Please note that whilst in most cases GYMBOX will be happy to provide you with copies of the information you request, GYMBOX nevertheless reserve the right, in accordance with section 8(2) of the DPA, not to provide you with copies of information requested if to do so would take “disproportionate effort”, or in accordance with Article 12 of the GDPR to charge a fee or refuse the request if it is considered to be “manifestly unfounded or excessive”.
</p>
<p><strong>The Right to Rectification, Restrict Processing, Erasure, and to Object</strong>
</p>
<p>You can ask GYMBOX at any time to change, amend or pseudonymise the information that GYMBOX hold about you or restrict ways in which your data may be processed.
You can update GYMBOX with amendments of personal information by submitting a request through the member services area of our website using the following link, <a href="member-services/change-of-personal-details.html">https://gymbox.com/member-services/change-of-personal-details</a>
</p>
<p>To pseudonymise the information, or object/request restriction of processing then please email <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#224f5b524750514d4c434e4643564362455b4f404d5a0c414d4f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9ff2e6effaedecf0f1fef3fbfeebfedff8e6f2fdf0e7b1fcf0f2">[email&#160;protected]</span></a></p>
<p>GYMBOX will aim to respond to any request as soon as possible, but no later than within 1 month since receipt of request. Please note that the right to erasure is not absolute and only applies in certain circumstances. For further information on this please visit the following link to the ICO’s website, <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/">https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/</a></p>
<p><strong>Right to Data Portability</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to request that your personal data is transferred by GYMBOX to another organisation (this is called “data portability”). Please contact us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#9af7e3eaffe8e9f5f4fbf6fefbeefbdafde3f7f8f5e2b4f9f5b4eff1"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3f52464f5a4d4c50515e535b5e4b5e7f5846525d5047115c50114a54">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> with the details of what you would like for GYMBOX to do and GYMBOX will endeavour to comply with your request. It may not be technically feasible, but GYMBOX will work with you to try and find a possible solution.
</p>
<p><strong>Right to Prevent Automated Decision Making</strong>
</p>
<p>You have a right to ask GYMBOX to stop any automated decision making. GYMBOX do not intentionally carry out such activities, but if you do have any questions or concerns GYMBOX would be happy to discuss them with you so please email any concerns or queries to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#f29f8b829780819d9c939e96938693b2958b9f909d8adc919ddc8799"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b4d9cdc4d1c6c7dbdad5d8d0d5c0d5f4d3cdd9d6dbcc9ad7db9ac1df">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>
</p>
<h4>9. Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
<p>GYMBOX may make slight changes to the Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions and Club Rules, however, will never materially change policies and practices to make them less protective of member information collected in the past without the consent of affected members. GYMBOX will display signage with details of any changes to these notices and conditions, but an up to date version will always be available on the website (<a href="index.html">www.gymbox.com</a>).</p>
<h4>10. Contact</h4>
<p>If you have any questions, comments or concerns about data privacy at GYMBOX, please e-mail thorough a description to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#65081c150017160a0b04090104110425021c08070a1d4b060a4b100e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="54392d243126273b3a35383035203514332d39363b2c7a373b7a213f">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> and GYMBOX will endeavour to resolve the issue for you.
Alternatively should you wish to escalate any concerns or questions, rather than contact GYMBOX directly, please contact the supervisory authority The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).
